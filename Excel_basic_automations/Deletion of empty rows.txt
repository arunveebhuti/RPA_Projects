Deletion of empty rows
----------------------

There are many cases where the Key will be empty in the excel sheet, this bot is designed to
delete those rows.

Approach: Down to top
Why: If we delete the rows from top to bottom, there is a chance of infinite loop as well as if we delete a row,
the total number of rows which has data will change, thus loop will not be correct

Explanation: 
1) Program will prompt for the file path, if we choose yes, it will proceed with default excel. 
   If we want to give a excel path, choose No and provide the path
2) Bot will open the excel and if not able to find the excel it throw the warning message
3) Bot will check whether any of the row is empty using the down to top loop, if found it will delete the row
4) Closes the  excel sheet
